Eg. ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el\r\n\r\n    (require 'tramp-hdfs)\r\n\r\nIt uses hdfs rest api/webhdfs which is supported in hadoop 1 & 2.\r\nThe syntax to open file in hdfs is just like opening file over tramp.\r\n\r\n    /hdfs:root@node-1:/tmp\r\n\r\nHere, root is the user that you want to use, node-1 is the name of the hadoop server.\r\nAs a general advice refrain from using superuser accounts like hdfs, hadaoop.\r\n\r\n## Supported features:\r\n* Directory browsing\r\n* Opening files\r\n* Deleting files/directories\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n* The server must support webhdfs\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n* Manually: Download tramp-hdfs.el and add the location to load path.\r\n* Through melpa:\r\nEnsure you have melpa in your package-archives\r\n(see [Melpa Installation](http://melpa.org/#/getting-started)).\r\nThen, M-x package-install [RET] tramp-hdfs. \r\n\r\n## Known issues:\r\n* Security is not supported.\r\n* It doesn't support writing to files to hdfs or acls.\r\n\r\n## Filing bugs & Feature requests:\r\nPlease open bugs at:\r\nhttps://github.com/raghavgautam/tramp-hdfs\r\n\r\nTo get tramp-debug logs:\r\n\r\n    (setq tramp-verbose 10)\r\n","google":"UA-62279331-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
